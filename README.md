# star of the city
an extension for the star of the city ttrpg 
a passion project made by a novice with a dream.
a Work in progress extension for this system on owlbear first thing on the agenda for me is:

-skill list with dice rolling 

-to get the speed dices into initiative connected to the tokens and if possible have the dices displayed above said tokens like how library of ruina does it

-connecting skills to speed dices 

-clashing with sounds 

-Dice changes when affected by buffs and debuffs

-Dice being reused.

once im done with the clashing and dice rolls next step is the character sheet which should be easier DX
